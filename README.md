Test task for  MyCointainer


The ansible should run on a Ubuntu new installation and do the following:
- install apache2
- setup apache to listen on a port specified by a variable APACHE_PORT
- set iptables to blocking all incoming
- open firewall port for apache2

I will need an Ansible Playbook for all the steps above.
